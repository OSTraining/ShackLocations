#### Advanced mapping extension for Joomla CMS

### Important
**Shack Locations is a fork of FocalPoint by John Pitchers and with his blessing. We're actively maintaining
it and have enjoyed the priviledge of building upon John's foundation.**

------

This is the repo for the Shack Locations mapping extension for Joomla.
It is compatible with Joomla v3.7 and higher. 

Use this extension to create advanced map based directories with
custom legends, markers, infoboxes and hundreds of locations.
Define the content for each location using CCK functionality,
and, give your users the ability to search and filter using familiar UI elements.
